This project is suppossed to read data from a api/scrapping and plot it, simple right?

I think I got "tagged" as ddos from the website I was scrapping and the free tier CoinMarketCap api dosent allow retrieving historical data.

"Ok just use other api/website", CryptoCompare api looks good but its https, wich crashes for some reason and there is not http, and I dont want to parse another website debugging everything in the Arduino IDE

So right now only shows static data I recolected from the months of sep-oct 2023
